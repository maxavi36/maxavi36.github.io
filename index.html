        <p>
            I am a god, and no one has my special name, Maxavier Stansberry.
            I am smart, very good at photoshop, and have a bachelor's in graphic design, 
            coding design, and coding. I am a amateur at graphic design, and passed the Adobe
            ACA exam for graphic design. I'm from and born in Baltimore, Maryland, and love the suburbs,
            despite moving from the suburbs for the rushing city.
